# Burger

The user can create their own burger and devour it while keeping track of what burgers they have devoured. Click [here](https://super-burger-feast.herokuapp.com/) to try it.

## Tools Utilized
* Express
* Express-Handlebars
* Body-Parser
* Bootstrap
* MySQL
* JawsDB
* Heroku

## Instructions
1. Enter burger name
2. Submit
3. Devour

## How It Works
The app stores each burger in a SQL database with a unique id and displays it. Each time a button is pressed the database is updated and new results are displayed.
